                Algebra
            </div>
            <p class="text">
Algebra is a part of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules <br>
for manipulating those symbols. In elementary algebra, those symbols <br>
(wich are written as letters) represent quantities withought fixed <br>
values, these are known as variables.<br><br>
Example:<br><br>
1 + a = 2<br>
What is a?<br>
<button onclick="alert('a = 1')">answere</button><br><br><br>
But algebra isnt alwase that easy, you can get more complex equations<br>
like<br><br>
5a - 20 = (10 / 2)<br><br>
To solve this you need to eliminate everything other than the algebraic<br>
symbols in the equation, so using that last question as an example you need<br>
to simplify the equation to just leave the 5a. This is how:<br><br>
5a - 20 = (10 / 2) ↓ Simplify<br><br>
5a - 20 = 5 ↓ Add 20 to both sides<br><br>
5a = 25 ↓ Devide by 5 on each side<br><br>
a = 5<br><br>
And thats algebra sometimes there is more that one symbol like a and b<br>
but they work like this<br><br>
2a + 10 = b + 10 ↓ Take away 10 from both sides<br><br>
2a = b ↓ Devide both side by 2<br><br>
a = b/2<br><br>
Sometimes in algebra they dont give perfect answeres, as displayed on top.<br><br>
Remember to simplify and alwase <b>whatever<br>
you do to one side do to the other.</b><br><br>
Good Luck.

                Angles and Parallel lines
            </div>
            <p class="text">
Angles in Parallel lines are the angles that are created when two parallel<br>
are intersected by another line called a <b>transversal.</b><br><br>
<img src="https://thirdspacelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angles-in-Parallel-Lines-Image-1.svg"><br><br>
We can use the information given the above diagram to find any angle around the intersecting transversal.<br>
To do this, we use three facts about angles in parallel lines:<br><br>
<li><b>Alternate angles are equal:</b></li><br>
<img src="https://thirdspacelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angles-in-Parallel-Lines-Image-2.svg"><br><br><br>

                Area
            </div>
            <p class="text">
In mathematics shapes are used alot, and the area of a shape is the space<br>
it takes up in a space. To work out the area of a shape you need to know<br>
the shapes height and width:<br><br>
Say you have a 2cm X 2cm Square.<br>
To find its area you times its height and width together, so for this square<br>
it would be 2cm X 2cm = 4cm^2.<br>
In maths 2d area is alwase measured in ^2, so if your measuring in cm's the<br>
measurement would be cm^2.<br><br>
<img src="https://www.mathsisfun.com/measure/images/square-m-vs-m-square.svg"><br><br>

                Data
            </div>
            <p class="text">
In mathematics data is information, and we use data charts to store that information,<br>
say a school played 50 games of basketball we could use a simple win's and loss's<br>
chart to dislay all that data (information) in a compact easy to read way.<br><br>
Example<br><br>
Out of the 50 basketball games the school played they won 27 of those games.<br>
In this example the data would be the number of win's and loss's (27 win's,<br>
23 loss's) and from this data a data chart could be made:<br><br>
<img src="images\image_2022-06-30_090933417-removebg-preview (2).png"><br><br>
That is a table chart but there are also other types of charts another common<br>
one being the Stem and Leaf diagram, the table chart was good for the last data set<br>
because it only had 2 varients Win and Lose but you can get data sets that are just<br>
pure numbers like this example:<br><br>
George wants to make a chart containing the ages of all 15 people in his town<br>
DATA = 10, 10, 13, 17, 21, 24, 25, 31, 35, 39, 47, 49, 51, 58, 64<br>
The problem is he only knows how to make table diagrams, and it would be very inpractical<br>
to put this data in a table diagram as it would have 14 rows.<br><br>
In this case we can use a Stem and Leaf diagram wich for that set of data would<br>
look like this:<br><br>
<img src="images\image_2022-06-30_102718938-removebg-preview.png"><br><br>
The disconected part of the diagram at the bottom is called the key it displays how it<br>
should be read, in its case 1 <b>|</b> 5 = 15, so the digram holds all the data neatly<br>
and in numerical order.<br><br>
Sometimes you will have a massive amount of non-repeating data wich would be heavily<br>
impractical for both table and Stem and Leaf charts, so if thats the case you can have<br>
a aproximation table wich is like the table chart but instead of giving you how many<br>
of a specific number there is in the data it gives you the amount of numbers between two<br>
points.<br><br>
Here is an example:<br>
Jhon has a big Data set of numbers between 1 and 100:<br>
DATA = 1, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 19, 21, 28, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 42, 44, 44, 48, 49, 51, 56,<br>
58, 66, 67, 74, 76, 77, 77, 79, 81, 86, 87, 95, 98, 100<br><br>
This data would take up alot of space on both Table and Stem and Leaf diagrams so Jhon uses<br>
an aproximation diagram wich for this data would look like this:<br><br>
<img src="images\image_2022-06-30_105704540-removebg-preview.png"><br>
So you can see from this type diagram in that Data set there are 3 numbers between 10 and 20.<br>
And 5 numbers between 30 and 40.<br><br>
<b>Remember when making a Stem and Leaf alwase add a Key.</b><br>

                Powers
            </div>
            <p class="text">
In this whole revision Powers are the most simple to do, lets show some examples:<br><br>
2 ^ 2 = 4 ( 2 X 2 = 4 )<br>
2 ^ 3 = 8 ( 2 X 2 X 2 = 8 )<br>
3 ^ 2 = 9 ( 3 x 3 = 9 )<br><br>
Basically the Power (the number in the top right of the base number) is how many times<br>
you times the main number by itself so ^2 = (num X num) and ^3 = (num X num X num), its<br>
quite simple.<br><br>
Test:<br>
5 ^ 3 = ?<br>
<button onclick="alert('125')">Answere</button><br><br>
Even though powers may seem simple, they get more dificult when you start going into<br>
negatives. Like 5 ^ -2 = ?, or -5 ^ 2.<br><br>
A little tip:<br>
5 ^ 2 = 25<br>
-5 ^ 2 = 25<br><br>
A negative number squared, cubed ect... Is the same as its posative counterpart<br><br>
The problems start when you have things like 5 ^ -2 = ?.<br>
Say we have the problem:<br>
4 ^ -2 = ?<br><br>
We can use whats called the reciprical of that to get:<br>
4 ^ -2 = 1 / 4 ^ 2<br><br>
Then we can work out 4 ^ 2 wich is 16 so we can simplify the equation:<br>
4 ^ -2 = 1 / 16<br><br>
Then we work out what 1 / 16 is, 0.0625, then we can plug that into our equation:<br>
4 ^ -2 = 0.0625<br><br>
Test:<br>
3 ^ -2 = ?<br>
<button onclick="alert('0.1111˙')">Answere</button><br><br>
Remember the <b>reciprical is the number flipped</b> so:<br>
2 = 2 / 1<br>
Reciprical:<br>
1/2<br><br>

                Propability
            </div>
            <p class="text">
In mathematics Propobility is the likelyhood or chance of an event occurring.<br><br>
Propobility = the number of ways of achieving success / the total number of possible outcomes<br><br>
For example, the probability of flipping a coin and it being heads is ½, because there is 1 way<br>
of getting a head and the total number of possible outcomes is 2 (a head or tail). We write P(heads)<br>
= ½.<br><br>
The probability of something which is certain to happen is 1.<br>
The probability of something which is impossible to happen is 0.<br>
The probability of something not happening is 1 minus the probability that it will happen.<br><br>
Example:<br><br>
There is a bag full of coloured balls, red, blue, green and orange. Balls are picked out and replaced.<br>
John did this 1000 times and obtained the following results:<br><br>
Number of blue balls picked out: 300<br>
Number of red balls: 200<br>
Number of green balls: 450<br>
Number of orange balls: 50<br><br>
a) What is the propobility of picking a green ball?<br><br>
Well as said for every 1000 balls picked out, 450 are green. Therefore P(green) = 450/1000 = 0.45<br>
45%<br><br>
b) If there are 100 balls in the bag, how many of them are likely to be green?<br>
To do this you need to know at least basic ratio click <u onclick="ratio()" class="clickText text">here</u> to look at it more.<br>
So you know out of the 1000 balls picked 450 of them where green so if there are only 100 picked (1000 / 10<br>
= 100, 450 / 10 = 45), you will get 45 green balls.

                Pythagoras
            </div>
            <p class="text">
Pythagoras is a formula for working out the third side of a triangle using the other 2 sides.<br>
First you need to know the names of the sides of the triangle:<br><br>
<b>Hypotenuse</b> · The longest side of the triangle.<br><br>
<b>Opposite and Adjacent</b> · The other 2 sides of the triangle.<br><br>
The Pythagoras formula is <b>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</b>, click<u class="clickText text" onclick="powers()">here</u> to learn more on powers.<br><br>
In the formula the a, b and c are placeholders for the length of each side, click<u class="clickText text" onclick="algebra()">here</u> to learn more on algebra.<br><br>
So if you had a triangle with the sides 3cm, 4cm and 5cm:<br>
<img src="images\image_2022-06-30_115623265-removebg-preview (1).png"><br><br>
For this we can fill in a with 3, b with 4 and c is missing, (the order doesnt matter) and then we can<br>
use the formula to work out the missing length (in this case the Hypotenuse).<br><br>
a^2 + b^2 = c^2<br>
3^2 + 4^2 = c^2<br>
9 + 16 = c^2<br>
25 = c^2<br><br>
So now we know that the length of the Hypotenuse ^ 2 = 25, so we can square root it to find the<br>
actual length of the Hypotenuse:<br><br>
√c^2 = c<br>
√25 = 5<br>
5 = c<br><br>
Now we add back our measurements, 5 = 5cm, then we worked out the missing length of this<br>
triangle<br><br>
Now this doesnt only work trying to find the Hypotenuse you can use it to find one<br>
of the smaller sides like the Adjacent or Opposite.<br>
<img src="images\image_2022-06-30_115623265-removebg-preview (2).png"><br><br>
So in this case we are missing b.<br>
Lengths:<br><br>
a = 3<br>
b = ?<br>
c = 5<br><br>
So if we plug these into the formula:<br><br>
3^2 + ?^2 = 5^2<br>
9 + ?^2 = 25 (we can take 9 away from both sides)<br>
b^2 = 16<br>
√16 = 4<br>
b = 4<br><br>
Now try this one yourself:<br><br>

                Ratio
            </div>
            <p class="text">
A ratio is the comparison of 2 numbers, for example if the ratio of 2 lengths<br>
is 1:2, then that means the second length is twice as big as the first.<br><br>
Example:<br><br>
Simon made a scale model of a car on a scale of 1:10. The height of the model car is 10cm.<br><br>
a) work out the height of the real car.<br>
To do this we need to know the ratio of toy:car wich is 1:10 so the car is 10 X the height<br>
of the toy, we know the toys height is 10cm so 10 X 10 = 100cm, the height of the car is 100cm<br><br>
b) The length of the real car is 500cm. Work out the length of the model car.<br>
We know the ratio of toy:car is 1:10 so if the car's length = 500cm, then that makes the toy's<br>
length 500/10 = 50cm<br><br>
so the dimentions of the toy = 50cm by 10cm : car = 500cm by 100cm<br>

                Sequences / N'th Term
            </div>
            <p class="text">
In mathematics a sequence is basically a pattern of numbers.<br><br>
Example:<br><br>
2, 4, 6, 8, 10<br>
This is a sequence.<br><br>
The question may ask to continue the sequence, if so you need to find the pattern<br>
of the sequence (in the example it is +2, because it goes up 2 every time), to do so <br>
you need to find the difference of 2 adjacent numbers like in the example we can use<br>
2 and 4, the difference being 2, then we can do the same with 4 and 6, difference = 2<br>
when you know the difference apply it to the last number of the sequence to get the next<br>
number like in the example, we know it goes up by 2 so it would continue, 12, 14, 16, 18...<br><br>
Closely linking with sequences is N'th Term wich is slightly more confusing.<br>
N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...<br>
2N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...<br>
3N = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15...<br><br>
Basically N = the posative number line and saying something like 2N just means for every<br>
number on the posative number line times it by 2 as shown on those examples<br><br>
The N'th Term doesnt only have to be timesed it can be added to:<br>
N+1 = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...<br>
N+2 = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...<br>
2N-1 = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9...<br><br>
A question may give you a sequence and ask you for the N'th term of it.<br>
Example of this:<br><br>
Find the N'th Term of this sequence.<br>
5, 10, 15, 20, 25...<br><br>
If we compare it to N we can see whats happening.<br>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>
5, 10, 15, 20, 25<br><br>
So as you can see they are being timesed by 5.<br>
So the N'th Term would be 5N.<br><br>
Test question:<br><br>
What is the N'th Term of this Sequence:<br>
4, 9, 14, 19, 24...<br><br>

            </div>
            <p class="text">
In mathematics Pi is used to find the circumference of a circle using its radius.<br><br>
<img src="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/images/pi.svg"><br><br>
Lets look at an example:<br><br>
Say you have a circle with a radius of 5cm.<br>
To find the circumference you use the formula <b>πR^2</b><br>
To find more info on powers and algebra click<u class="clickText text" onclick="powers()">here</u> and <u class="clickText text" onclick="algebra()">here</u>.<br><br>
So for our example we can fill in R with our radius, 5cm.<br><br>
πR^2<br>
π X 5^2<br>
π X 25<br><br>
Now we can actually talk about Pi the number is an irratinal number meaning it is<br>
infinatly long and never repeats the same way.<br>
Pi is approximately equal to:<br><br>
3.14159265358979323846...<br><br>
But when using it in maths we generaly only need to use up to the 3rd significant figuare<br>
(more if you want extra presition).<br><br>
Back to finding the circumference of our circle.<br><br>
π X 25<br><br>
We can fill in π for 3.14.<br><br>
3.14 X 25<br>
= 78.5<br>
= 78.5cm^2<br><br>
Remember to use cm^2 instead of cm because its area.<br>
