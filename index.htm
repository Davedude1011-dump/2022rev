                Algebra
            </div>
            <p class="text">
Algebra is a part of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules <br>
for manipulating those symbols. In elementary algebra, those symbols <br>
(wich are written as letters) represent quantities withought fixed <br>
values, these are known as variables.<br><br>
Example:<br><br>
1 + a = 2<br>
What is a?<br>
<button onclick="alert('a = 1')">answere</button><br><br><br>
But algebra isnt alwase that easy, you can get more complex equations<br>
like<br><br>
5a - 20 = (10 / 2)<br><br>
To solve this you need to eliminate everything other than the algebraic<br>
symbols in the equation, so using that last question as an example you need<br>
to simplify the equation to just leave the 5a. This is how:<br><br>
5a - 20 = (10 / 2) ↓ Simplify<br><br>
5a - 20 = 5 ↓ Add 20 to both sides<br><br>
5a = 25 ↓ Devide by 5 on each side<br><br>
a = 5<br><br>
And thats algebra sometimes there is more that one symbol like a and b<br>
but they work like this<br><br>
2a + 10 = b + 10 ↓ Take away 10 from both sides<br><br>
2a = b ↓ Devide both side by 2<br><br>
a = b/2<br><br>
Sometimes in algebra they dont give perfect answeres, as displayed on top.<br><br>
Remember to simplify and alwase <b>whatever<br>
you do to one side do to the other.</b><br><br>
Good Luck.

                Angles and Parallel lines
            </div>
            <p class="text">
Angles in Parallel lines are the angles that are created when two parallel<br>
are intersected by another line called a <b>transversal.</b><br><br>
<img src="https://thirdspacelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angles-in-Parallel-Lines-Image-1.svg"><br><br>
We can use the information given the above diagram to find any angle around the intersecting transversal.<br>
To do this, we use three facts about angles in parallel lines:<br><br>
<li><b>Alternate angles are equal:</b></li><br>

<li><b>Corrisponding angles are equal:</b></li><br>
<img src="https://thirdspacelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angles-in-Parallel-Lines-Image-3.svg"><br><br><br>
<li><b>Co-interior / exterior angles add up to 180°</b></li><br>

                Area

            <p class="text">
In mathematics shapes are used alot, and the area of a shape is the space<br>
it takes up in a space. To work out the area of a shape you need to know<br>
the shapes height and width:<br><br>
Say you have a 2cm X 2cm Square.<br>
To find its area you times its height and width together, so for this square<br>
it would be 2cm X 2cm = 4cm^2.<br>
In maths 2d area is alwase measured in ^2, so if your measuring in cm's the<br>
measurement would be cm^2.<br><br>
Practise:<br>
Find the Area of a rectangle of the Dimentions 5cm X 3cm<br>
<button onclick="alert('15cm^2')">answere</button>
